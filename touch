Converts .wav(wave) file into a data sequence where the samples are scaled in a bit range. Ex. an 8 bit range outputs a sequence within the rane 0-255. <br>

This will output a data_sample.txt file containing the sounds scaled, and made for the struct format shown below:
``` c
struct Sound = {
  uint32_t length;
  uint8_t samples[];
}
```
